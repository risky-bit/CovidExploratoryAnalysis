# CovidExploratoryAnalysis
This is my portfolio project based on Covid-19 data-set using SQL-Server. I used SQL Server Management Studio.

I initially distributed the dataset into two excel files for two tables. 
One mainly with the deaths information and other with the Vaccinations information.

I tried to get insights of total cases against population or total cases against deaths. 
Also, no. of vaccinations against populations or a rolling sum for vaccinations each day for each country.
This project includes use of CTEs, Temp Tables, & Views. 

I'll keep on improving and adding more queries to this as I analyse the data-set.
